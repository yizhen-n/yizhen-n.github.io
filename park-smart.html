                As mobile payment becomes popular, more parking lots joined the internet platform to make parking easier. This project focus on 'how to help drivers find suitable parks quickly'.
                Firstly, we need to know what suitable means.

        <h4 class="work-subtitle">User Research</h4>
        <p class="work-paragraph">
            6 drivers took individual interviews. They were all accustomed to navigation softwares and had driving experiences in the Netherlands within 6 months.
            To thoroughly understand parking behaviors, I used the steps below to help interviewees recall their parking experience and dive deep into the topic:

            <br><br>1. Open topic: personal driving habits, favorite places to go, apps, driving frequency.
            <br>2. Recall the scene: how they find and select parks, when, what difficulties.
            <br>3. Share opinions: preference, love and hate, key points.

            <br><br>Distance  &#11088&#11088&#11088&#11088&#11088<br>
            The distance to destination is the first thing drivers consider. <br>
            If they arrive a new city as a tourist, locations near city center is much appreciate, because it’s easy to travel from the center to anywhere.
            In other words, they value the connectivity.

            <br><br>Price/Discount   &#11088&#11088&#11088&#11088<br>
            When price information are available, drivers tend to weigh the balance between price and distance. They have threshold for both side. Young
            employees are especially attracted by discount or free zones.

            <br><br>EasyPay   &#11088&#11088&#11088<br>
            For drivers already using parking apps, they love the convenience brought by mobile payment.

            <br><br>Time & pricing   &#11088&#11088&#11088<br>
            Min- and max- parking time, free period, extra hour cost and the fear of someone towing their car away. Having to take care of these
            information is a dark cloud in their hearts.

            <br><br>Spacious   &#11088<br>
            Although not happening frequently, sometimes drivers can’t find a free spot when they arrive,
            despite the phone shows ‘spacious’ 1 hour ago.

            <br><br>Guide to Entrance   &#11088<br>
            In unfamiliar places, drivers want to find parks easily and avoid driving on the wrong side.

            <br><br>How drivers view these informations is also very crucial, when they walk to the car or handle the phone to the passenger, they expect
            quick answers. The app should provide a informative, integrated but direct overview of the available parking solutions with less taps on ‘more’
            and ’back’ buttons. For long distance travel, they also desire to receive real-time report
            on how many spaces is left to avoid entering a full park after hour’s travel.
        </p>


        <h4 class="work-subtitle">Applying the research to interaction design</h4>
        <p class="work-paragraph">
            The main tasks and related pain points were defined based on the interviewee's parking behaviors. The priority also directly affected the app's information structure: for higher priority like price and distance, I put balanced solutions on dashboard, and highlight price and distance info. While medium priorities like opening hour or pricing were placed on secondary pages,
            so passengers can read for the driver.

        <h4 class="work-subtitle">Prototyping</h4>
        <p class="work-paragraph">
            For continuous testing, the prototype covered the whole loop from search, go, pay to new search. Visually the blue tone receding colors won't distract drivers' attention,
            and the blue 'P' mark in real-world parking lot is also used on map view.
