                 Nearly one sixth of Dutch population have the risk of skin cancer. My client UVisio wants to help women grow effective sun protection habit via a wearable device and an app. In two years, we developed the product from 0 and got angel investment successfully.
                 To get a grip of this journey, this article will walk through the app's dashboard iterations.

         <h4 class="work-subtitle">Attract investors</h4>
         <p class="work-paragraph">
             The goal of interface design in incubator phase is to showcase our technology-driven scenario to attract investments. Data were placed explicitly so that investors could understand how UV data transferred to protection advices. To target to-B customers, we also created white label examples.

         <h4 class="work-subtitle">Structure information based on user behavior</h4>
         <p class="work-paragraph">
             We targeted mothers with young kids and carried out interviews in local playgrounds.
             Surprisingly they value precautions more than real-time protections, especially for the young kids.
             So I rearranged the information architecture according to the 3 steps recognized from their protection behaviors.
             <br>1. Decision - see intuitive UV level to help decide whether to go outdoor.
             <br>2. Preparation - know what precautions to take, how to apply sunscreen properly.
             <br>3. Time in the sun - notifications for reapply sunscreen and risk of sun burn.
             <br><br>Feedback on visuals:
             <br>1. Bright, high-contrast for outdoor environment.
             <br>2.The screens should feel more relaxed, less numbers, more graphic elements.

         <h4 class="work-subtitle">Plan the route from newbie to expert</h4>
         <p class="work-paragraph">
             As we have increasing email subscribers and sufficient fund for product development,
             I switched my focus to user's on-boarding experience.
             A good experience let users gradually gain higher resolution of information through different phases,
             feel like experts regardless of the phase. In our case, a young woman can gradually gain knowledges of skin and sun protection,
             practice effective daily protection,
             and eventually feel like an expert of individual / the whole family's skin protection.
             <br><br>
             At the entrance of this route, I introduced detailed and actionable UV forecast as a basic function for frequent use,
             so users with low signup intention could also open our app frequently.
         </p>
         <div class="work-images">

             Designing on-boarding experience is balancing give and take.

         <p class="work-paragraph">
             There's a struggle between 'less amount of user input' and 'more accurate protection advice'. All inputs were organized in an 'on-boarding card' as 3 icons to be enlightened.
             But after prototype testing, we found users not very triggered to complete the whole process.
             <br><br>
             In this case, it's really necessary to categorize all inputs by:
             <br>1. registry input - show benefit explicitly to trigger, minimize the input amount.
             <br>2. base input (location, skin type) - the key input to enable main function. Highly dependent on user's own characteristics.
             <br>3. beneficial input (sunscreen SPF) - We can set none/zero at first, then toggle optional inputs after user has accessed the main function. They help enhance the result.
             <br>It became clear that we should delay sunscreen input, so the whole on-boarding process could be simpler.

         <h4 class="work-subtitle">Hardware as upgrade, not addition</h4>
         <p class="work-paragraph">
             To prevent the app become useless when device has error in outdoor situation, user can enter 'basic protection' without device, or 'active protection' by connecting device. But test shows users are confused with these 2 modes. There's only one task: outdoor protection,
             and the hardware should just help better complete the task, instead of adding more task.
             The insight I got here is that we need a unified interface to help user switched easily between software
             and hardware during the task.
             Using the hardware should provide sense of upgrade by giving small but exciting changes on
             familiar elements.
             <br><br>
             On the other hand, we can't let user satisfied with the experience without device.
             After all, we sell device to make profit. So we need to point out inconvenient places to trigger user look for device solution, for example, users will miss mobile notifications when playing on the beach, but they can certainly hear device clipped on their bikinis.

         <h4 class="work-subtitle">Postscript</h4>
         <p class="work-paragraph">
             From the PowerPoint animation to mass production products,
             I'm very lucky to get through the whole development process and see the app's launch. For early stage startup company, there're always uncertainty of marketing, technology selection or even features' priority, but the target customers' daily scene is always our guide for discussion. As a designer I'll keep practicing on using the minimal interfaces to create better scenes for customers.
             Now in a sunny day, I'll also open our App to check whether it's time to apply sunscreen :)
